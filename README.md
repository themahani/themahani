I'm a Machine Learning Scientist (AKA, an *AI Nerd* 😉) with a passion for automation and crafting tools that make life easier. I thrive on building solutions that leverage APIs to conquer those repetitive, time-consuming tasks we all dread.

My journey started with a BSc in Physics, during which I dove headfirst into the world of Computer Science through self-study. This blend of disciplines fuels my approach to problem-solving and innovation.

Currently, I'm immersed in the fascinating field of Computational Neuroscience at the University of Calgary. My thesis is centered around **Reservoir Computing using FORCE training**, and I'm excited to make the code publicly available in the coming months - stay tuned!

I have a passion for the financial markets and love creating automation solutions for the financial sector as well.

As a strong believer in **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)**, I'm a proud user of:

* 💻 **Operating System:**  Arch Linux (7 years strong!)
* ⌨️ **Text Editor:** NeoVim (check out my config in [themahani/dotfiles.git](https://github.com/themahani/dotfiles.git))
* 🖥️ **Terminal Emulator:** Kitty
